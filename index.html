            <h1>Games that I have completed in 2023</h1>
            <p>
               I don't have many hobbies, and after running into some work related issues earlier this year (i.e. getting laid off), 
               I've regressed into what I was during high school: a loser that only plays video games.  
               So!  For this site I've decided to log how many games I have played through, or remember playing through, this year.

            <h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
               Starting off on a high, this is the big one folks.  
               This is probably the best game I've played this year, or at least the best new game, and certainly the most memorable one.
