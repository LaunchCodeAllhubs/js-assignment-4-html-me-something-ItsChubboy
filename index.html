            <h1>Games that I have completed in 2023</h1>
            <p>
               I don't have many hobbies, and after running into some work related issues earlier this year (i.e. getting laid off), 
               I've regressed into what I was during high school: a loser that only plays video games.  
               So!  For this site I've decided to log how many games I have played through, or remember playing through, this year.

            <h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
               Starting off on a high, this is the big one folks.  
               This is probably the best game I've played this year, or at least the best new game, and certainly the most memorable one.
               This game was addictive, it's a good thing I finished it weeks back because it was overtaking me.
               I couldn't get away from it. It consumed me. So y'know it was pretty good I guess.

            <h3>Final Fantasy I-V</h3>
            <p>
               I'm grouping all these together because I'm both lazy and economical. I played through the first five numbered Final Fantasy games earlier this year and I'm inclined to say that it was a mistake.
               Not that the games were bad, gentle reader, just that they are so similar to each other that I needed to space these out way more to prevent burnout. Alas, burnout was not prevented.
               Definitely taking a break before I jump into VI, the last one I haven't played yet.

            <h3>Overwatch 2</h3>
            <p>
               I play this because it's the only game that both me and my friends play. I don't have much to say. It's not good. 
               Maybe I need more friends in addition to more hobbies...
